## About the Game
Every festive season, Santa embarks on his global sleigh journey, spreading holiday cheer by delivering presents to homes. Who can blame him for dropping a couple along the way? Besides, that's what elves are for! Step into the jolly shoes of one of Santa's little helpers and catch the presents that fall from his sleigh. But beware of the dangerous anvils plummeting from above! Make sure to be on your best behavior as you try to earn Santa's special rewards for swift grabs and impressive catches. Best of luck on this merry mission!

## How to Play
The main gameplay loop consists of the player stacking presents as they fall from the sky. They must place their presents on the ground to receive their score for each stack. To increase difficulty, if any part of a stack or the player is hit by an anvil, all of the current presents are reset.

The game will always only end when the player loses their three lives. A life is lost when the player or their current stack of presents is hit by a falling anvil. When the game ends, the score is displayed to the player before providing them options to restart, return to the main menu, or quit.

Although there is technically no “game-ending” winning condition, the player’s main objective is to score as many points as possible. This is achieved by stacking more and more presents, but different strategies may be applied. For example, bonus points are awarded to players for placing higher stacks or placing stacks quicker. While one person may try to create high stacks in a short amount of time, another person may take their time with smaller stacks to avoid falling anvils with greater ease.

## Final Reflection
In aspiring to become a game designer, this project emphasized the importance of all aspects of game development. While brainstorming ideas, I faced limitations in art skills and time constraints for coding, highlighting the necessity of considering the contributions of artists, programmers, and other team members. My goal with this game was to test and improve my skills in design, programming, and art, while creating a small, finished game. Despite recognizing areas where improvements could be made, such as better assets or longer gameplay, I am pleased with what I achieved as a solo developer within a short time period. This experience deepened my understanding of the challenges involved in game creation and fueled my eagerness to explore collaborative approaches.
