- later fixes
	- create seamless audio (persistent in all scenes)
	- check walk animation (add hat) for player
	- check button click for scene switch (audio)
	- look at adding separate collider for player or adjusting size after first present
	- address the proper game balance (add difficulties?)

	- assets
		- sleigh?

	- stretch goals
		- change sprites for presents
		- add special present for extra life
		- make presents "fly" when hit by anvil
			- need to add either a coroutine or get it in update somehow
